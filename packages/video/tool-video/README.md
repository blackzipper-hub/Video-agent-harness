# @cuti-ai/tool-video

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

Stable, high-level tools that let a DeepSeek agent operate a versioned video project without exposing provider-specific calls.

Project creation and planning require a five-field video language contract. The Agent keeps UI locale, user-visible authored content, speech, subtitles, and provider prompt language independent and preserves those fields in every plan patch.

`video_checkpoint_inspect` accepts `checkpoint_id="live"` to open a planning snapshot for a user edit during execution. Use the returned id and revisions with `video_plan_patch_submit`. Task completion/failure notifications and live edits share the same append/cancel path; only pending tasks can be cancelled, and unrelated running tasks continue. See the [Runtime scheduling rules](../../../services/video-runtime/README.md).

For corrected-parameter retries, submit `replace_failed_task_ids` mapping failed IDs to new `add_tasks` client keys. The Runtime replaces pending descendants atomically; completed outputs remain reusable. A failed continuous Build can be inspected with `checkpoint_id="live"` and stays stopped until the repair patch commits.

## Model Experience

### Project video tools

#### What the model sees

The [23 `video_*` tools](../../../docs/tool-catalog.md#cuti-aitool-video) expose project creation, Cuti-compatible continuous `PlanPatch` planning, project inspection, structured edit and dependency impact previews, rebuild execution, durable build control, artifact selection, and export. `video_edit_preview` returns cost and affected steps but never executes paid work. Provider credentials, internal tasks, plugin hooks, and raw media operations are absent from the schemas.

#### Token effect

Fixed schema cost while the tool plugin is enabled; results are data-dependent and bounded summaries.

#### KV Cache effect

Prefix-stable while the enabled tool set is unchanged.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

- Project ids are explicit tool arguments in the first release; automatic active-project injection into tool arguments remains deferred.
